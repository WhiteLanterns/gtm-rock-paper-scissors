This is a simple project that uses OpenCV computer vision and
Tensorflow image processing AI trained using Google Teachable
Machine (GTM) to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the player.

## IMPORTANT:
**Due to the keras .h5 file exported by GTM, the only**
**known compatible Python version is 3.11**
